## Disclaimer
Indonesian Boundaries is still in a development version but is quite ready to use.

Use this package if you have minimal knowledge of maps or have no time to learn about maps, [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and want to focus more on major software development.

We are using sources based on Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS - Statistics Indonesia) and maybe the source will change at any time in the future.

The data used cannot be used as a standard reference for real boundaries in Indonesia. We are not responsible if there are differences in boundaries in the field and misuse of this data.

- Customizable
  - The resulting map can be customized easily and at will according to the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.7.1.html) references.
